Part1: Web and user interface using Django
People in charge: Henry and Mark
Problem:  
We need to create a web that has the following functions:
1.	It can let users to register a new account. 
2.	It can let users to log in and log out.
3.	It can show a profile page of users which contain the basic information and their money.
4.	It can send verification code to the user to verify their email. (Email is used to reset their password)
5.	It allows trade between different users in this web.
Program Rules and checklist:
1.	When registering a new account, a new page is uploaded that require the information of this user (username, password, birthday, email address, age, gender, phone number)
2.	If the username has already been existed in the database, then we will require users to change another username until it is not repeated.
3.	Then it will upload a new page to require users to verify their email address. 
4.	Our web will send a random number as a verification code. If the code users entered match the verification code, their email address are verified.
5.	There is a log in button and log out button in the home page. If users click the login, then it will upload to a new page which require users to enter their username and password.
6.	Also, there is a “Forget your password” button in the page. When user click this button, a new page will upload to require users to enter their username and email address. Then a verification email will be sent to this email address to let users to reset their password.
7.	After logging in, users can click the “Profile” button to browse their personal information and review their balance.
